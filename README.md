# Vishal Soman

I’m a software and data engineer with experience building data pipelines, analytical tooling, and machine learning workflows. My work spans large-scale data processing, backend architecture, and applied NLP/ML systems. I focus on reliable engineering, clear structure, and reproducible results.

## Areas of Focus

- Data engineering: ETL, data modeling, SQL/PostgreSQL, workflow automation  
- Software engineering: Python, backend development, containerized applications  
- ML/NLP: document ingestion, vector search, retrieval pipelines, evaluation tools  
- Analytics: exploratory analysis, feature engineering, dashboard development

## What I’m Interested In

Designing systems that make complex data usable. I enjoy working across the full pipeline, from ingestion and transformation to retrieval, analysis, and reporting, and building tools that make that process efficient and maintainable.
